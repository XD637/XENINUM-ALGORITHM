# XENIUM-ALGORITHM

(Assume XeniumCoin as Cryptocurrency - I'm working on it)

Let's assume you have initially 10 xenium coins, call it iv (initial value). 
for each xenium coin you spend (sv), the value of the one last xenium coin depreciates in a way, 
when the total xenium coin spent becomes 9 (in this case), 
the true value (tv) of the xenium coin becomes 0% (initially it is 100%), 
which means you can not spend the last xenium coin since it lost it's true value.
Means 1 became 0 .

This algorithm shows the peculiar way of depreciation based on the how much you spend,
you may not realise but even if you spend the smallest amount , it changes the true value and depreciates it.
what happens when the depriciation is recursive? means it itself changes the Xenium value,
It is more complex and i'm working on it.
