# XENNIUM-ALGORITHM

(Assume XenniumCoin as Cryptocurrency)

Let's assume you have initially 10 xennium coins, call it iv (initial value). 
for each xennium coin you spend (sv), the value of the one last xennium coin depreciates in a way, 
when the total xennium coin spent becomes 9 (in this case), 
the true value (tv) of the xennium coin becomes 0% (initially it is 100%), 
which means you can not spend the last xennium coin since it lost it's true value.
Means 1 became 0 .This algorithm shows the peculiar way of depreciation based on the how much you spend,
you may not realise but even if you spend the smallest amount , it changes the true value and depreciates it.
